<ul>
  <li>LangGraph is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs, used to create agent and multi-agent workflows.</li>
  <li>LangGraph allows you to define flows that involve cycles, essential for most agentic architectures.</li>
  <li>As a very low-level framework, LangGraph provides fine-grained control over both the flow and state of your application, crucial for creating reliable agents.</li>
  <li> LangGraph includes built-in persistence, enabling advanced human-in-the-loop and memory features.</li>
